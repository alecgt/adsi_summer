				<h5>Who is Neurohackademy for?</h5>

				<p class="a">There's no single answer to this; in the past, Neurohackademy (formerly Neurohackweek) has attracted applicants and participants from a wide range of backgrounds, career stages, and skill levels. In general, however, our prototypical participant is an early-career researcher--most commonly a mid-to-late stage graduate student or early postdoc--who has some prior experience analyzing neuroscience data, as well as basic computational literacy (including minimal familiarity with basic programming concepts). On the spectrum of the many training courses out there, Neurohackademy fits somewhere between beginner courses and advanced courses. We assume a basic familiarity with core concepts in both neuroscience and computational science, but we also give priority to applicants who do <i>not</i> have strong expertise in both domains. If you don't know what a for-loop is, you'll probably get more out of an introductory course like <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>. Conversely, if your full-time job is developing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for joint EEG/fMRI-based clinical prediction, this probably isn't the right course for you either. But if you fall somewhere in between these extremes, congratulations--you're our target audience!</p>

				<p class="a">We also strongly encourage members of groups that are underrepresented in science to apply. Diversity is one of our explicit evaluation criteria, and we work hard to try and make Neurohackademy a comfortable and welcoming environment for people of all races, genders, orientations, nationalities, and other backgrounds.</p>
