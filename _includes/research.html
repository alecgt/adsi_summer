				<p class="a">Imitation learning refers to the problem where a learner is trying to imitate or mimic an expert decision making rule. The goal is to design algorithms able to learn how to execute a specific task from examples of good behaviors. By solving an empirical superquantile minimization problem instead of the classical risk minimization problem, we intend to tackle the statistical challenge of imitation learning, that is that the data used to design the prediction model and the data actually encountered are not drawn from the same distribution.</p>
